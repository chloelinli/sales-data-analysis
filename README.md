# Data Analytics Portfolio
Hello! Welcome to my repository - these are my personal projects :)

## Completed
### [Tokyo Airbnb Analysis](https://github.com/chloelinli/chloelinli.github.io/tree/main/projects/tokyo_airbnb_analysis)
In order to practice using Tableau and R, I decided to turn a personal interest into a project. This will then be used to assist in researching for my future trip to Japan. I received constructive criticism from friends who I plan to travel with to help improve the dashboard and make it easier to navigate. I then created an interactive dashboard written in R and deployed as a Shiny app.

### [U.S. Population Trends](https://github.com/chloelinli/chloelinli.github.io/tree/main/projects/us_population_trends)
Advanced medicine and technology have contributed to an increased birth rate, correlating to an increased population. Due to overpopulation concerns, it seems that natural increase is a more significant factor in population increase compared to immigration. To complete this project, I compared U.S. public birth rate data with 2010-2020 census results, as well as researched reliable quotes and sources.

**Skills**: Microsoft Excel/Google Sheets

## In Progress
### [Sales Data Analysis](https://github.com/chloelinli/chloelinli.github.io/tree/main/projects/sales_data_analysis)
**Skills**: SQL, Microsoft Excel/Google SHeets

### [My Personal Spotify Listening Habits](https://github.com/chloelinli/chloelinli.github.io/tree/main/projects/spotify_listening)
I wanted to see how the type of music I used to and currently listen to may affect my future music taste. Using my Spotify streaming history from the past year, I cleaned and queried the data so that I could have the top 50 most listened to songs to analyze and compare to the music phases I had gone through.

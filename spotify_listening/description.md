## Question:
How will the changes in my personal music taste affect my future listening habits? 

### Data and Approach
#### Data
Personal Spotify streaming history from Novebmer 2021 to November 2022.

#### Approach
* Took top 50 most listened to songs
* Compared listening habits between genre and language of songs
* Analyzed with major music phases of my life and when certain tops songs were released

### Findings and Conclusion
I have consistently listened to Chinese music for a couple of years despite having previously been interested in Kpop and lofi music. Thus, I am more than likely to continue to listen to Chinese music. My current most listened to song was recently released June 2022. The high listening count coupled with the recent release allows me to infer that it will continue to remain a favorite song in my listening rotation.

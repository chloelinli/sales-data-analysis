## Question:
What Primarily Contributes to U.S. Population?

Without immigration and natural increase, the U.S. population would not be what it is today. But which of these two factors is the main contributor?

### Hypothesis
Birth rates are the primary contributor to the growing U.S. population.

Thanks to advanced medicine and technology, birth rates have increased while death rates have decreased, and this means that through natural increase there is a greater increase in population as well.

### Data and Approach
#### Data

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics. National Vital Statistics System, Natality on CDC WONDER Online Database. Data are from the Natality Records 2007-2020, as compiled from data provided by the 57 vital statistics jurisdictions through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program. Accessed at [http://wonder.cdc.gov/natality-current.html](http://wonder.cdc.gov/natality-current.html) with requested records 2011-2020 on Oct 29, 2022 5:51:00 PM.

#### Approach
* Fit linear model census data and 2050 population approximated by CDC to estimate population growth
* Fit linear model to change in births per year and percentage of births each year out of total births between 2011-2020
* 2050 trajectory: Fit linear model to total births per year to estimate births in 2050
* 2050 trajectory: Fit linear model to birth rate each year to estimate birth rate in 2050

### Findings and Conclusion
Despite advanced medicine and technology, the birth rate has been declining. However, immigration trends are gradually rising. Potentially, immigration will overtake birth rates at a 2-to-1 ratio, and have already done so in the 2021 fiscal year.
